I added the sodium.jar file and discovered that by putting it into the parent directory, 
my IDE stops showing errors related to the jar. I wish I knew about this in previous 
assignments since my test files would show errors because it could not detect classes and
functions from the JUnit jar.

detailed explanation of what I have done in each commit.
