\\---------------- Commit #13 on 20/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Implemented a timer that will clear the event if 3 seconds go by without another event 
occurring.



\\---------------- Commit #12 on 20/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Updated GpsEvent's toString() function to meet assignment spec. Added timestamp to display.
Updated display to be more visually appealing.



\\---------------- Commit #11 on 20/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I have started implementing the AllEventsComponent. I have set up a rudimentary display so 
I can see whether the merging worked as intended.



\\---------------- Commit #10 on 18/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I updated a test to not use the listen() function because it does not seem to execute the
handler function while running the test. The test now checks the value by holding values of 
the stream in cells and then sampling those cells. Wrote some documentation for my testing
document.



\\---------------- Commit #9 on 18/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Wrote another test for SimplifiedTrackersComponent. The test checks that the cells are 
being passed the correct data and that each group of cells are for the correct tracker.



\\---------------- Commit #8 on 18/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Created own file for SimplifiedTrackersComponent and wrote a test for it. It tests whether
the stripAltitude() function correctly sets the carried over fields. The test doesn't 
explicitly check whether the altitude is stripped, because it is obvious and easy to see 
that the SimpleGpsEvent does not carry that field.



\\---------------- Commit #7 on 18/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Created stripAltitude() function to convert a GpsEvent stream to a SimpleGpsEvent stream.
Also stored the cells used in the first display, and pass the constructor streams directly
to aid testing. Created skeleton test file.



\\---------------- Commit #6 on 17/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Added a JTabbedPane to switch between each of the required GUI displays. Updated the first
display to be more visually appealing.



\\---------------- Commit #5 on 17/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Created SimpleGpsEvent to represent a GpsEvent stripped of its altitude. I mapped the 
GpsEvent stream to the new SimpleGpsEvent class to strip the altitude. To extract the 
required fields for the first display, I used map() 3 times to 3 different cells. I then
added SLabels to track and display the values of the cells as they get updated.



\\---------------- Commit #4 on 16/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Updated myGUI class to extend JFrame and moved some configuration options over to main().
Added the arrays I believe I'll need for the construction of the first component.



\\---------------- Commit #3 on 16/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I created the myGUI file which will create my GUI design using a few subclasses. Also set
some configuration for the JFrame, and wrote some skeleton code.



\\---------------- Commit #2 on 13/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I added the sodium.jar file and discovered that by putting it into the parent directory, 
my IDE stops showing errors related to the jar. I wish I knew about this in previous 
assignments since my test files would show errors because it could not detect classes and
functions from the JUnit jar.



\\---------------- Commit #1 on 13/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Just setting up the directory and given files. I'll mainly use this file to give a more
detailed explanation of what I have done in each commit.
