\\---------------- Commit #6 on 17/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Added a JTabbedPane to switch between each of the required GUI displays. Updated the first
display to be more visually appealing.



\\---------------- Commit #5 on 17/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Created SimpleGpsEvent to represent a GpsEvent stripped of its altitude. I mapped the 
GpsEvent stream to the new SimpleGpsEvent class to strip the altitude. To extract the 
required fields for the first display, I used map() 3 times to 3 different cells. I then
added SLabels to track and display the values of the cells as they get updated.



\\---------------- Commit #4 on 16/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Updated myGUI class to extend JFrame and moved some configuration options over to main().
Added the arrays I believe I'll need for the construction of the first component.



\\---------------- Commit #3 on 16/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I created the myGUI file which will create my GUI design using a few subclasses. Also set
some configuration for the JFrame, and wrote some skeleton code.



\\---------------- Commit #2 on 13/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I added the sodium.jar file and discovered that by putting it into the parent directory, 
my IDE stops showing errors related to the jar. I wish I knew about this in previous 
assignments since my test files would show errors because it could not detect classes and
functions from the JUnit jar.



\\---------------- Commit #1 on 13/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
Just setting up the directory and given files. I'll mainly use this file to give a more
detailed explanation of what I have done in each commit.
