Updated myGUI class to extend JFrame and moved some configuration options over to main().
Added the arrays I believe I'll need for the construction of the first component.



\\---------------- Commit #3 on 16/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I created the myGUI file which will create my GUI design using a few subclasses. Also set
some configuration for the JFrame, and wrote some skeleton code.



\\---------------- Commit #2 on 13/10/2022 ------------------------------------------------//
I added the sodium.jar file and discovered that by putting it into the parent directory, 
my IDE stops showing errors related to the jar. I wish I knew about this in previous 
assignments since my test files would show errors because it could not detect classes and
functions from the JUnit jar.

Just setting up the directory and given files. I'll mainly use this file to give a more
detailed explanation of what I have done in each commit.
